# TODO: Complete All Tasks from Original TODO List

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Add framer-motion to package.json dependencies and install it.
- [x] Update Home.tsx landing page: Import framer-motion, add rotating elements, particle effects, enhanced gradients, hover states on button.
- [x] Update Home.tsx dashboard: Add hover animations to metrics cards, background overlays, animated icons/progress bars, glowing borders/shadows.
- [x] Ensure designs are responsive (use Tailwind responsive classes) and accessible (add ARIA labels, focus states).
- [x] Run npm run dev to test changes and check for console errors.
- [x] Update TODO.md to mark all steps as completed.

## Notes:
- Focus on modular changes to avoid breaking existing functionality.
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling, supplemented by framer-motion for animations.
- Test on different screen sizes for responsiveness.
